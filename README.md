Network Monitor v0.7
A real-time network monitoring system that captures, analyzes, and visualizes local network activity ‚Äî all in a lightweight, Python-based interface.
This version introduces anti-spam alert cooldowns (sensor v0.6) and a modern Dash dashboard with live data visualization (dashboard v0.7).

üß† Overview
The system consists of two main components:
sensor_v0_6.py ‚Äî A packet sniffer and behavioral analyzer using Scapy.
Captures IP/TCP/UDP traffic
Detects insecure or suspicious connections
Generates alerts with cooldown logic
Logs traffic and device activity to SQLite
dashboard_v0_7.py ‚Äî An interactive web dashboard built with Plotly Dash and Cytoscape.
Displays live network traffic
Shows real-time alerts
Maps device communication visually
Lists discovered devices with manufacturers

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/DSAI-Society-IIIT-Dharwad/Nismo.git
cd Nismo

2. Install Dependencies
pip install dash pandas scapy mac-vendor-lookup dash-cytoscape

üöÄ Usage
Step 1 ‚Äî Start the Network Sensor
Run with administrator/root privileges:
sudo python3 sensor_v0_6.py

This script will:
Initialize or update sentinel.db
Begin capturing all IP/TCP/UDP packets
Detect devices by MAC address and manufacturer
Generate alerts for:
Insecure protocols (FTP, Telnet, MQTT, etc.)
Suspicious ports (RDP, SSH, SMB, ADB, etc.)
New/unseen device connections
Save live packet logs to network_traffic.log
You‚Äôll see output similar to:

üöÄ Starting network sensor v0.6... (Anti-Spam Brain)
Monitoring devices on subnet 10.0.3.*
Alert cooldown set to 10 minutes.
NEW DEVICE: Found new device with MAC 84:C2:E4:12:34:56 at 10.0.3.42
ALERT (CRITICAL): Insecure protocol detected: Telnet (Insecure Remote Login) to 34.120.19.5
ALERT (Info): New connection detected: 10.0.3.42 -> 8.8.8.8:443 (TCP)

Step 2 ‚Äî Launch the Dashboard
Open a new terminal and run:
python3 dashboard_v0_7.py

Then open your browser and go to:
üëâ http://127.0.0.1:8050

üåê Dashboard Overview
Tab	Description
üó∫Ô∏è Network Map	Visual representation of recent device connections (30 latest)
üö® Security Alerts	Displays real-time alerts sorted by severity
üíª Discovered Devices	Lists known devices with MAC address, manufacturer, and timestamps
üìä Live Traffic	Shows the latest 50 packets captured in real time
Map Visualization

Internal nodes = Local devices (your network)
External nodes = Remote IPs (connections)
Edges = Communication between internal and external nodes

üõ°Ô∏è Smart Features
Feature	Description
üîç Device Discovery	Automatically identifies new devices by MAC vendor
‚ö†Ô∏è Port Intelligence	Flags insecure and suspicious network ports
üß† Behavior Profiling	Learns normal communication patterns for each device
üîï Alert Cooldowns	Prevents spammy alerts by enforcing per-event cooldowns
üì° Real-time Updates	Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
üåê Interactive Network Map	See device relationships with Dash Cytoscape
üíæ Persistent Storage	SQLite + CSV for full network history
üß∞ Configuration

Edit these variables in sensor_v0_6.py to match your network setup:

YOUR_SUBNET_PREFIX = "192.168.1."
ALERT_COOLDOWN_MINUTES = 10

The subnet prefix ensures alerts and discovery only apply to your own devices.
The cooldown (in minutes) controls how often the same alert can repeat.
